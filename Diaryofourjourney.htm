<h2>November 5, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spokane, Seattle, and Oregon</p>

<h2>October 29, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The drive through Wyoming was pretty nice a first, beautiful
country with mountains, ranches, cows, real cowboys, and other different
animals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But after a while there were
no towns, only one or two roads and not much else.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Montana was a lot of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Finally after several days of driving we arrived at the western entrance
to Yellowstone National Park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our first
drive into Yellowstone proved to be a little difficult.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On our way into the park we ran into a heard
of buffalo, literally.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Buffalo were
all over the road, there must have been about 30 of them, small ones, little
ones, and big huge ones.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They came
right up next to the car, fortunately none of them decided to come into the
car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also saw geysers of all different
types, hot springs with beautiful clear blue and yellow colors, and when we
were walking around the one hot spring area a heard of elk decided to walk
around with us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One even walked right
behind Giustina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We saw Old Faithful,
although it was kind of a let down, just a big spray of water in the air.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other geysers were much prettier with a
lot more color than Old Faithful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That
evening we had a really good meal at a local restaurant, steaks really are
better in Wyoming and Montana.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After leaving Yellowstone we drove through Idaho on our way
to Seattle, WA about 900 miles away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
first stopped in Twin Falls, ID and saw their local waterfalls.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They weren’t very spectacular since it was
the end of fall and not much water was coming over them, but I imagine in the
spring time they would look pretty amazing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After eating so much read meat in Wyoming and Montana we had a good sea
food dinner at a restaurant called Rock Creek. After we left Twin Falls we drove
through the Craters of the Moon National Monument which is the site of several
volcanic explosions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We then drove up the western side of Idaho.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We stopped at a winery on the way and got
the RV stuck in a parking lot trying to turn around.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>When we realized we couldn’t get the RV to move a very nice
person asked if we needed help.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Of
course we said yes because we really had no other choice and before we knew it
he went in the back and brought out a John Deere tractor and chain to help pull
the RV out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a pretty small
tractor in comparison with the RV so we didn’t know if it would work.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before we had a chance to try it though
another man came out with a HUGE backhoe/tractor that was at least as large as
the RV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We hooked the chain up to this
huge mammoth beast and in two seconds we were unstuck.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We tried to go out and thank both men but
before we could they were gone, just like that.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It was an amazingly nice thing that they did for us and really
helped us out of a jam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We continued on
to a very nice winery, and drank and bought some really good wine.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We continued our drive and stopped at a gas
station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I was filling the tank a
random person noticed that our spare tire on the RV was falling off, probably
because of the last incident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Before I
could get the toolbox out and try and get it back on the guy was under the back
of the RV putting it back into place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Again before I could offer them something for their help they took
off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Again an amazing gesture of
kindness, you would never find this kind of help in downtown Boston.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We continued on our drive on a two way one
lane road that half way through turned into a torn up road that was just gravel
and huge potholes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When we finally
found some more pavement and took a look at the white car we were towing it was
pitch black.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We finally found an RV
park and stopped for the night.</p>

<h2>October 22, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>After spending some time on the Mississippi it was off to
the twin cities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We picked a campground
on the edge of the city in a town called Prior Lake.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>From reading the description it seemed like it would be a nice
place to stay including a heated pool, sauna, and whirlpool.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When we arrived at the campground we
realized we picked a campground that was part of a local casino.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And instead of the campground being a nicely
wooded area outside the twin cities, it was actually a cement paved glorified
parking lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of the spaces in the
“park” were paved and there were street lights near every spot.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It looked like the campground was just a
section of the parking lot for the casino.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In fact the first evening as we went to walk to the casino we heard some
music being broadcast over loud speakers in the parking lot.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By 11 PM when we turned in for the night the
music was still playing and by 3 AM as I rolled over in bed the music was still
playing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was like Chinese water
torture with music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We awoke the next
day only slightly rested given our crummy nights sleep and planned our attack
on the Mall of America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For those of
you who haven’t been to The Mall of America I will try and describe it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The mall is about four to five times as
large as any other mall and encompasses a total of 78 acres.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fact it contains over 520 stores, just
about every store you could possibly think of, and if that was not enough in
the middle of the mall inside it there is an amusement park.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The park includes a roller coaster, log
flume ride, Ferris wheel, and merry go round.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>All in all outside of the overall size of the mall it was nothing
special, just a REALLY HUGE mall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
can’t even image what it must be like the day after Thanksgiving.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next day after we awoke from our Chinese
water torture music serenade, we decided to check out of the RV campground,
leave the RV in the casino lot, and head into downtown Minneapolis.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We drove into town and had breakfast at a
place recommended by the book Eat Your Way Across the USA.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The place was called Al’s Breakfast and
consisted of a room that was about 12 feet wide by 30 feet long.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It had a counter the entire length of the
room with a single row of seats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You literally
had to squeeze past the stools looking for a seat at the counter.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We found a seat, took a look at the menu and
ordered breakfast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Both of our
breakfasts were delicious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You could
smell the grease and fat in the air.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
was one of the best breakfast joints we have ever been too.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After breakfast we spent some time walking
around the downtown Minneapolis sky way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We then drove back to the RV and on to our next destination South
Dakota.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On our way to South Dakota we planned to stop by one of the legendary
icons of roadside America, The Largest Ball of Twine.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It took us quite a while to get to the Ball of Twine and by the
time we arrived we were very anxious to see it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Unfortunately it wasn’t a very memorable experience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The town with the Ball of Twine has at most
200 people and the Ball of Twine is on a side road in an outdoor gazebo all by
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They even enclosed it in glass
so you can’t even touch it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even the
gift shop, if you can call it that, was closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It was kind of a let down and on top of it all it started to
rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well after driving over four
hours to see a bunch of string enclosed in glass we still had quite a few hours
left till our next destination, so we decided to just drive for a couple more
hours and park for the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
couldn’t find a campground near by so we ended up staying in a rest stop on the
side of the road.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If you have ever
stayed in a road side rest stop you no that they are not exactly quiet, in fact
the tractor trailers are quite loud.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The next morning as we awoke from our crummy half nights sleep we knew
we had quite a few miles left to go on our way to Mount Rushmore.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We started our drive through more of South
Dakota and stopped by another roadside icon, The Corn Palace.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Corn Palace, located in Mitchell, SD, is
basically a building covered in corn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It’s a pretty large building on top of it, about the size of a small
stadium.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It’s also the only thing in
town outside of your standard tourist trap stores.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The residents even change the corn on the building once a year,
what a country…<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the Corn Palace
we continued our drive, and drove, and drove, and then when we though we were
somewhere we drove some more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time
we realized that we still had four hours to Mount Rushmore we were in the middle
of no where, it was dark, and we were exhausted.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We got off the road we were on in a local town and tried to drive
around the town looking for a campground or rest area.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunately none were found, in fact we
had a hard time even finding a paved road in the middle of town.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When we stopped to look at the map to see if
there was anything else in the area, we had the pleasure of meeting a local
resident otherwise known as a bum begging for money.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We decided that this was not the place to stay for the night so
we drove some more and found a rest stop about an hour away.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had a crummy nights sleep as was to be expected in a
roadside rest stop and on top of it all we were awoken the next morning at 5:30
AM local time with Giustina’s phone ringing off the hook.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We tried to answer it but since we were
sound asleep at the time we didn’t get to the phone in time.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After we regained consciousness we checked
the message and realized that on top of it it was a wrong number.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since this was the third time we had gotten
wrong number phone calls Giustina decided to return the call.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It turns out that the person calling a dean
at a local vo tech school was looking for a professor.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He kept saying I was dialing 650465533, now
we aren’t any rocket scientists but I think we can recognize a phone number
when you see it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dean didn’t
realize that the number he was trying to call, 3 times in the last few days
wasn’t even a valid phone number!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
people wonder why most kids in America can’t write or do simple math.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had a few more hours of driving to do and
on the way we stopped by Wall, SD and the Wall Drug Store.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This drug store was advertised on roadside
billboards from more than 600 miles away so we felt obligated to at least check
it out and see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As you might expect the
town of Wall is not exactly a booming metropolis, in fact the Wall Drug Store
takes up more than a block of the downtown area.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It was an amalgamation of junk store, clothing, diner, tourist
mementos, and even gun shop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They had
everything EXCEPT a drug store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Apparently the pharmacists who started the drug store had passed away
quite a few years ago and their children just kept the store going.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We stayed in the town of Custer, SD at a decent campground
but a pretty useless town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Cruddy
supermarket, no real restaurants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
one night we wanted to eat at 8PM we ended up going to Pizza Hut because it was
the ONLY place open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We visited Mount Rushmore and Custer State Park, we saw a
variety of animals and some really cool scenery.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Mount Rushmore itself was really impressive, it’s amazing that it
was just one mans vision and insight that made it a reality.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also visited the world’s third largest
cave, Jewel Cave, nothing really special other than the fact that it was pretty
big and dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We also had quite an introduction to how honorable people in
this part of the country are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First the
office of the campground we stayed at was closed when we arrived with a note on
the door saying pick any spot and then pay the next day.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Second the state park that we went to just
had a sign with rates and a box to deposit your entrance fee.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And then the one that just put it all over
the top was the driving range.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The range
is open but there was no one there, you just go up pick up a bucket of balls
and leave your money in a mailbox.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>That’s it, I can’t even think of how that would work in downtown Boston.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We then moved from Custer, SD to Spearfish, SD, a little
more north in the state.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We stayed in a
nice local mom and pop campground with some very nice hosts.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They recommended a restaurant called the Bay
Leaf Café which we ate at.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a
pretty decent place and they had excellent seafood, something that we were
dieing for after several weeks of beef eating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We visited the nearby town of Deadwood and saw Wild Bill’s death chair
at the Saloon #10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All up and down the
main street of Deadwood were mom and pop casino’s, it was pretty odd to see a
casino / 7 11 / hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also visited
Lead, SD and the largest gold mine in the US called the Homestake gold
mine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That evening on our way to dinner
Giustina was driving down main street in Spearfish when a police car appeared
in the rear view mirror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was the
nicest police officer I have ever heard, he was so nice.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We didn’t think we did anything wrong but
the officer said we were going 36 in a 25 mph zone, can you believe that?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>11 mph over the speed limit in a 25 zone?<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He obviously had nothing better to do except
bother us but since we were just visiting he let us off with just a warning,
how nice…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next we left Spearfish, SD on our way through Wyoming.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We visited Devils Tower National
Monument.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a pretty ominous site
to see, it just kinda hangs out there in the middle of no where, pretty neat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We also saw a variety of cows, horses,
prairie dogs, sheep, and deer a long the way.</p>

<h2>October 15, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Onward we traveled to Milwaukee, WI.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had to go here mostly because we saw a
CBS Sunday Morning TV show about a butterfly exhibit at the local museum.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We pulled into a campground that was located
a few miles south of the city called Jellystone campground, just like Yogi
bear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apparently Hanna Barbara created
a sort of campground franchise and they have these parks all over the
place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first day in Milwaukee we
decided to just bum around the city and see what it was like.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a Sunday morning and the town was as
desolate as Fenway Park during the world series.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We were walking around trying to see if anything was open, just
about everything we say was closed, until we say a line of parents and their
children shuffling into a large building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We approached the entrance and saw that they were all going to a Disney
on ice show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well it seemed unlikely
that we would be able to go but Giustina really wanted to see the show.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We went inside and much to my surprise we
got in without a problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The one thing
Disney does really well is sell and market itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They had Disney cups, Disney cotton candy, Disney popcorn, Disney
lights and glow wands, and everything was of course at Disney prices.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The show itself was one of the better ice
skating shows we have seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I didn’t
even fall asleep once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day we went to the Butterfly Exhibit at the local
museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For those of you who didn’t see
that CBS Sunday Morning show I’ll do my best to describe it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You enter the butterfly wing through a kind
of air lock by passing in through the first door, closing that door, and then
entering through a second door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
keeps all of the butterflies from flying away into the other areas of the
museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Through the second door you
enter the butterfly area which is a fairly small room about 30 feet by 15
feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The room is decorated with all
different types of tropical plants and rocks with a main path along the middle
length of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All around fly
hundreds of different species of butterflies, they are on the plants, the
rocks, the walls, and sometimes as Giustina found out, if you stand still
enough they even land on you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a
very cool experience and we highly recommend it to anyone.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The rest of the museum was pretty boring but
the butterfly wing more than made up for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next stop on our journey was the Miller Brewing
Company.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Miller has a major presence in
Milwaukee and their brewing factory takes up several city blocks.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The tour began by allowing us to walk
through their processing facility behind some Plexiglas walls as we watched
case after case of Miller beer being packaged for shipping.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oh and just in case any Kellogg executives
read this the Miller tour was FREE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
end of the tour was the highlight as we got to sample some free beer, well
Miller anyway but it was free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After
this it was on to the gift shop as all tours seem to end up in the gift
shop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were actually able to purchase
some new Titlest golf balls for less than $2 / ball, pretty cool, thanks
Miller.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That evening we ate at an
excellent German restaurant called Karl Ratzsch’s.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It was recommended by both Zagat and the book Eat Your Way Across
the USA and it did not disappoint us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Not only did it have excellent German beer on tap but the food was much
better then I ever expected.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On our final day in the Milwaukee area we decided to take in
some golfing at the Blackwolf Run golf course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This was an absolutely spectacular facility.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Everyone was very helpful and nice and the two courses and
supporting facilities were some of the best we have ever played.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We played the Meadow Valley course and it
was in excellent shape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However it was
also the most difficult course either of us have ever played.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was so much sand always in the place
where your ball wanted to land that I felt like a beach comber.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We couldn’t get the ball to stay on the green
from 50 yards out with a sand wedge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The greens were rolling and curving always away from the hole
location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time we got on the one
hold that had an almost flat green neither of us remembered how to putt on a
flat green.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It really kicked our butts
and I would welcome the challenge of playing it again after several more years
of practice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our next venture in Wisconsin brought us to the town of
Wisconsin Dells and Lake Delton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>These
towns probably have the highest concentration of tourist trap businesses we
have ever seen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Mile after mile of
cheesy little museums like the Circus World Museum, tee shirt stores, useless
trinkets, miniature golf by the trunk load, small mom and pop amusement parks
with the dumbest themes like Noah's Ark - America's Largest Waterpark etc.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Fortunately for us most of these places were
closed for the season but the one place we were there for was open, Tommy
Bartlett’s Robot World.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time we
arrived in town it was too late to go to Robot World so instead we opted for
the standard tourist trap museum Ripley’s Believe it or Not.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It had the standard concoction of the most
bizarre items you can imagine including a car made completely out of wood and a
bowl made out of a human skull.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After
we got our fill of the bizarre we went next door to the local Wax Museum where
they had some of the worst recreations of American movie stars, celebrities,
and other famous personalities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
only thing that reminded us that these wax figures were actually who they said
they were were the little name plates beneath each figure.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next day we wanted to get a taste of
some real Wisconsin cheese.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You are
always told that the best cheeses in America come from Wisconsin, but so far on
our journey we saw no trace of any type of cheese making operation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally in this little tourist trap mecca we
found a brochure for a local cheese “factory”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We had been somewhat skeptical of these types of factories given our
previous pretzel factory experiences, but I have to say we were greatly
surprised.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When we approached the Carr
Valley Cheese Factory I thought we were in for another pretzel experience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The place was a small free standing building
in the middle of no where.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was
one large tractor trailer on the side and a couple cars in the small parking
lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Upon entry to the building the
woman behind the counter immediately deduced that we were there for the free
tour that was advertised on the brochure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She brought us to a wall which displayed pictures of the cheese making
process and began a short audio tape that described what was happening in each
of the pictures.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Although a bit
amateurish it was very informative.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After the audio presentation we were able to go through the factory,
really just two main rooms, and see cheese in the process of being made.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were able to walk right up to the workers
making the cheese, talk to them, ask them questions, and pretty much do what
ever we wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a very
refreshing change from the very structured tours that most large corporations
put on like our previous Miller tour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We got to talk with the employees and learn a little about their lives
as well as the cheese making process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>All in all it was a very informative tour and the major corporations of
the world would be well to copy what the Carr Valley Cheese Factory folks have
done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After we appropriately gorged ourselves on cheese we were on
to the main event, Tommy Bartlett’s Robot World.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Now why this attraction had to have Tommy Bartlett’s name strewn
across it I’ll never know, perhaps he was just egotistical and wanted to be
remembered, and why it’s called Robot World I will also never know since we
didn’t really see any robots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Robot
World is laid out like a walk through attraction you start by entering a space
ship, actually it is an elevator decorated like a space ship, that transports
you into Robot World.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then you see your
first and last look at a robot who introduces Robot World to you.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After this you walk around going through a
variety of high school science fair like exhibits like see how light looks as
it goes through this prism or figure out how to stack these 20 nails on top of
each other so they do not touch the table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>For the most part the exhibits are fairly lame, there were two good
exhibits though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first was a
virtual reality game where you could play goalie in a soccer match.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The second was a Van de Graf generator that
you could walk up to and touch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You
would never see this type of exhibit at Disney World though.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They actually let you walk right up to it
and if you leaned over far enough, as I found mistakenly, you get a really large
shock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It snapped so loud it sounded
like a gun went off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Other than that it
was a little bit of a let down experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having been let down by man’s scientific creativity, we
decided to drive on to La Crosse, WI and the mighty Mississippi river.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We selected a campground that was right on
the Mississippi and got a site where our bedroom window looked right over the
river.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was really awesome to
see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even though the river isn’t that
wide up north here, it was still an amazing site to see.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We went on a cruise on the river boat the La
Crosse Queen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a nice boat and a
fairly decent tour including historical accounts of how some of the original
settlers had to build various dam creations to help raise the water level of
the river in order to allow larger boats to ship cargo.</p>

<h2>October 8, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our next stop on our trip was Ohio, we decided to stay in
Oberlin Ohio just south west of Cleveland.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This allowed us to be near Cleveland, Akron, Canton, and Sandusky
Ohio.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first day we decided to trek
down to Canton Ohio and the Pro Football Hall of Fame.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Giustina really enjoyed this as she got to
see Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, and Steve Young’s memorabilia.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After this we drove up to Akron Ohio to
visit Inventure Place, the inventor’s museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They had some interesting displays on inventions and random scientific
stuff, and best of all we got there an hour before they closed so we didn’t
have to pay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It really wasn’t worth the
$7.50 to get in just to see a bunch of patent numbers on the walls.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were a little hungry after all this
scientific learning so we decided to go to a place recommended by a friend of
mine called the Skyway Drive-in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now
with a name like that I wasn’t really sure what to expect.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps a drive up teller window with food,
no. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Maybe a movie with dinner like the
old fashioned drive in’s, nope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was
a 50’s style diner where the waiter’s and waitresses come out and serve you at
your car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Course we didn’t know this
going in and had to make asses out of ourselves as we tried to walk into the
building where they cooked the food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Once we figured out what was going on with the ordering process we
actually had a pretty good greasy spoon burger.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day we decided to spend some quality time on the
golf course.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We golfed at a course
called Fowler’s Mill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was supposedly
the best course in Ohio and since we didn’t have any other Ohio courses to
compare it too it may very well have been.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>In comparing it to the other great courses that we have played I would
rank it in the middle of the pack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Nothing really great stood out about the course.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After golf we took a drive along lake Erie
toward a local amusement park called Cedar Point.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The drive was very nice, this was the first chance we had to see
one of the Great Lakes and we were not disappointed, it was really huge.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And speaking of huge, the houses along the
lake were enormous.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of them would
of cost multiple millions of dollars back in Boston.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The Cedar Point amusement park is known for having some of the
best, biggest, and highest roller coasters in the world and they definitely did
not disappoint us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because we were
there during the evening not all the coasters were open but we did get to go on
three of them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first one called The
Raptor was one of the new designs in roller coasters made of metal pipe tubing
and shoulder harness seats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now it’s
been quite a number of months since we had been on a roller coaster and we
probably shouldn’t have started with this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It shook us up, down, upside down, around and every which way.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>When we got off it took me 5 minutes just to
figure out that my stomach didn’t really belong in my throat.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After we walked around for a while, I felt
an urging desire to subject my body to another one.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The next coaster we went on is called The Millennium Force and is
the highest coaster in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we
waited in line I caught a glimpse of the first hill, it was so high I could
barely see the top of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The people on
top look so small they looked like gnats.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We got into our seats and the bar lowered across our laps.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I thought to myself this is it, just this
little bar?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The last coaster we were on
practically prevented any part of your body from moving, all this one did was
put a one inch bar between me and sudden death.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>As the coaster started out it went up the highest hill faster
then any other coaster I had ever been on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Once up top I felt like I could touch the stars, I was happy that there
were lights on the coaster so that low flying planes could avoid it.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we crossed the top and started our fall
back to earth I felt like I was free falling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was an incredible feeling of adrenaline.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Our last coaster was The Mantis and it was unlike any other we
had been on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>First there was no seat,
you stand and are strapped in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then the
coaster goes through five loops inside out upside down right side left
etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>By the time we got off I had no
idea which side was up down or in between.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was a hell of a ride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next stop on our journey was going to be Chicago, but
that was about 5 and a half hours away and we didn’t really feel like driving
that far.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So instead we looked at the
map and searched for something in between.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Well there isn’t a ton of places to go between Oberlin Ohio and Chicago
Illinois so we picked Battle Creek Michigan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Why not go and see where Frosted Flakes are made.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even though Battle Creek isn’t a really big
town, there are no real campgrounds in downtown Battle Creek, so we decided to
stay in Union City Michigan just south of Battle Creek.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our sole purpose for coming here was too see
the Kellogg Plant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well we quickly
learned that Kellogg doesn’t give plant tours anymore but that we could spend a
visit to Kellogg’s Cereal City.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That
sounded good enough.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We tried to go on
Monday but they were closed so we went to the Underground railroad monument and
golfed instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next day we went
back to the tour to see.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On arrival we
realized that we had to pay to go in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Can you believe that we paid money to be marketed to and sold cereal
subconsciously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What kind of marketing
genius thought of this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And it
wouldn’t be that bad if it was a few dollars but they wanted $6.50 a
person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well we had to pay, I didn’t
drive to Battle Creek for nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
paid our $13 dollars and went inside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Inside we were overcome with a deluge of Kellogg memorabilia and
advertisements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They had a mock
assembly line displaying how cereal is made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>A series of televisions showing old Kellogg commercials.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>a photo booth where you could have your face plastered on a box of
Kellogg’s Corn Flakes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So of course in
keeping with this obvious display of commercialism and blatant marketing we had
to pay an additional $16.50 to have our faces put on a box.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oh well long live capitalism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our next stop was Chicago, the windy city. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>There weren’t many RV parks in the greater
Chicago area but we picked the one that was closest to downtown since we
figured we would be driving in and out of town quite a bit.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was called the Windy City RV park, I only
tell you this because no one should ever have to stay at this dump again.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It began when we tried to get a space for
our RV, now they told us the had one that would fit a 35 foot 102 inch wide
motor home and it did JUST fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had
enough room for the RV, the door to swing open and a picnic table.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You could barley walk around the RV with the
amount of space that we had.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the
next door neighbor had their window open I could have spit on their dining room
table from inside our RV.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ok so it was
a little tight no big deal, then came our first night in the park.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well, as I said before the park was about as
close to Chicago as you could get without actually being in Chicago.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because of this we were strategically
positioned RIGHT NEXT to the highway which was very convenient.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the other hand the noise from the highway
lasted night and day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You could
constantly hear the roar of the 18 wheelers engines and the cruised by the park
at 70 miles an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was like living
on a runway with planes constantly flying over you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Ok so two strikes not so bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Well the final straw came the next morning as we arose from our crappy
nights sleep still with the thoughts of roaring trucks in our head.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I went to take a shower it smelled a
little funny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now in an RV every once
in a while you get a strange odor from the holding tanks if things aren’t as
clean as they could be and that’s all I thought it was.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Until I actually got into the shower and
realized that the stench was coming from the water itself.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It stunk, just like a sulfur pit combined with
spoiled eggs and rotten garbage all mixed into one.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">    </span>Ah well I guess that’s what you get when you are just looking
for location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We spent the next day site seeing in downtown Chicago.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We saw the Aquarium, Planetarium, and the
Navy Pier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After this we felt a little
hungry and what better way to quench that hunger than with an original slice of
Chicago’s deep dish pizza.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And as per
the recommendation of Mr. Stormy we decided we would go to Gino’s East.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Unfortunatly we were on the other side of
town and didn’t feel like driving into downtown so we decided to take a cab
instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now having lived in Boston for
a number of years we were all used to cab drivers and the dangers that they
bring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The erratic driving, running up
the fare by going the wrong direction, smelly cabs etc.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well I have to say if our cab driver is any
indication of the cab drivers in Chicago every cabbie should be required by law
to go to Chicago to learn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ride
started out rather poorly as the cab driver misheard the destination that we
were going to and by the time he realized it we were way out of wack.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So following standard cabby protocol he
turned the meter off (it read about $4.80) and proceeded to our real
destination.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On our way I figured that
when we got there I would be spending a good deal of time arguing with him as
to how much to pay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I figured it would
probably cost about $10.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well we got to
the address where we thought Gino’s was only to find out that Gino’s
moved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So the cab driver asked a local
bell hop if he knew where it moved to and got the new address.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He then proceeded on to the new location
still with the meter turned off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now at
this point I’m thinking this is going to cost about $20 if we are lucky.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well we arrived at Gino’s and as we were
exiting the cab the cabby said $4.80.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Wow can you believe that no additional charge, no raising the price
nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We felt so bad for the guy
that he had to drive us all over town that I gave him $10 and he was unusually
thankful.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had excellent pizza at Gino’s
and we highly recommend this place to anyone who wants original Chicago deep
dish pizza.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day we decided to spend some quality time on the
links.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We played a round at the site of
the PGA tour’s Western Open, Cog Hill.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The course was very nice and a bit challenging at times but not
overwhelming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>That evening we went to
Morton’s of Chicago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now anyone who
knows us knows that we love red meat and Morton’s did not disappoint.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I had a beautifully cooked porterhouse and
Giustina had a melt in your mouth Filet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It was absolutely delicious.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On our last day in town we did some more of the touristy
type things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We figured we would go to
the world famous Museum of Science and Industry.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Now the museum itself was very nice, however getting into the museum
was quite a chore.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It started with a
drive into the parking lot from hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This lot was probably as big as Foxboro stadium and the spaces were as
small as the Rowes Wharf garage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Finally after level and level of filled parking spaces we found an empty
space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then we going walking into the
entryway of the museum to purchase tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Now at most museums in the world you walk up to the counter hand them
your money and get your ticket, maybe if it is a large museum you have to pay
extra for a show or two.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well this
place was like the Disney land of science museums.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>There was a pricing board the size of the train schedule boards
at South Station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And there were so
many different combinations of ticket prices I couldn’t even begin to decipher
them. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Well fortunately we bought
general admission tickets in combination with some other tickets in advance and
all we needed to do was trade in our vouchers for tickets, you would think this
would be quick and simple process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Fortunatly there was a special line for this type of procedure and as we
waited I looked over to see where the regular folks were purchasing their
tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>WOW, their line looked like
the check-in line at US Air the day before Thanksgiving.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was HUGE.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Boy were we happy that we didn’t have to stand in that line.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were second in line and just as the
ticket agent was finishing up with the folks in front of us, POW.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All the lights went out and the emergency
lighting came on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had no idea what
was going on, and neither did any of the workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>All the computers that were issuing the tickets shut down and we
began the waiting process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We waiting
and waited and waited, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, a voice came over the loud
speaker stating that the local power company had a brown out and was working on
correcting the problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In all 30
minutes went by of us waiting and waiting, as parents with their now screaming
kids, were trying desperately to come up with something to amuse them with.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally the power came back on and we
completed our transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then just as
we were walking up the steps to enter the museum a voice came over the loud
speaker stating that because of our patience during this delay all general
admission tickets would be FREE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Can
you believe that FREE wow what a bargin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then I remembered that we already purchased our tickets in advance and
that they were non-refundable, DOH.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The
museum itself was very nice, I wouldn’t exactly say it was world class but it
was fun.</p>

<h2>September 30, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is Sunday September 24<sup>th</sup> and our journey has
officially begun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We have left the
confines of our parent’s driveway for the cruel realities of the United
States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Our first destination the city
of brotherly love about 2 and ½ hours south.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Well not really the city, a northern suburb of the city, which was fine
with me since I really didn’t want to drive a 35 foot RV into downtown
Philadelphia anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The purpose of our
first stop is to visit with some long lost friends of ours, Dean and Nicole.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We were anxious to see Dean and Nicole because
we hadn’t seen them in over a year and they had a new baby daughter Sophie that
we hadn’t seen since she was first born.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The trip from northeast Pennsylvania to the northern suburbs of Philly
was pretty uneventful, just a straight shot down the northeast extension of the
PA turnpike.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We didn’t want to make it
very complicated seeing as how this was our first real trip.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We arrived at Dean and Nicole’s home late
Sunday afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had a great time
catching up with them and playing with Sophie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Sophie had just turned one year old about 2 months ago and she is an
adorable baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She played with all of
her toys and we watched a Sesame Street video.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I had no idea how many of the old Sesame Street songs I could actually
remember from Ernie’s rubber ducky to the Count’s counting song to Oscar’s I
Love Trash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have to tell you that I
have no idea how parents ever took care of their kids before the invention on
the VCR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is amazing how mesmerizing
a Sesame Street video can be to a one year old. (Or for that matter a 29 year
old)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We stayed the night with our
friends and the next morning headed off to our next destination Amish country
and Lancaster Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the next leg of our trip we decided to get a little more
adventurous in our route selection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I
have always thought that if you want to see America you should “see America”,
so we decided to take our RV off the Interstate on onto some of the more scenic
roads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We strolled along the winding 2
lane roads on our way to our campsite in Intercourse, Pennsylvania.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Can you believe someone actually named a
city Intercourse?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What were they
thinking?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Anyway, the drive again was
fairly straight forward, the only difficulty was trying to keep the 102in wide
RV between the double yellow lines and the edge of the road.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It seems since most of the Amish don’t have
cars, they ride in horse and buggies, that the roads they built around the area
weren’t really built to accommodate our width.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>It proved a little challenging but I managed to get us to our campsite
at Beacon campground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The campground
itself was fairly nice much more subdued than our first campground experience
in Massachusetts (see below).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next
morning it was raining so we decided to spend it indoors at the Pennsylvania
Railroad Museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We saw many different
types of locomotives and railroad cars including several large electric
locomotives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the museum we went
across the street to take a ride on the Strasburg railroad.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The railroad was a restored passenger train
with a steam locomotive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Even though it
was raining the passenger cars were enclosed so we were dry and it was a nice
ride through the Amish countryside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>After the train ride we decided to keep with the train motif for the day
and visit the National Toy Train Museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>They had all different types of toy trains including ones from the
1800’s that were “child powered”, meaning you just pushed them, to some
beautiful brass locomotives from Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the Toy Train Museum it continued to rain outside and
seeing how most of the shops in the area were outside we were at a little bit
of a loss as to what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some where
along the way we had picked up a tourist pamphlet for the Intercourse Pretzel
Factory with free factory tours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This
seemed like an interesting indoor activity so we decided to try and find this
factory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had the name of the place
where the factory was but didn’t see any factory looking building.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finally we spotted a sign in a strip mall
for the “pretzel factory”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We went
inside and sure enough this small little place in a room that couldn’t have
been more than 20 by 20 was the factory.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We went up to the counter to ask the young Amish girl if they gave free
tours as it stated on their pamphlet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>She said they did and the next one would be starting in about 20
minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We decided since we had
nothing better to do and it was still raining out that we would wait and go on
the “tour”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we waited we purchased a
soft cinnamon pretzel and ate it as we strolled around the shop looking at the
items that they had on display.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You
would expect that a pretzel factory would have pretzel type memorabilia, well
since this one wasn’t much of a factory, there was no reason for them to sell
pretzel type memorabilia.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instead they
had tons of junk, and I use the term junk because no other term would describe
the amount of useless stuff that this place had.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Everything from a 1920 mixing bowl to a cook book from 1973 about
how to make things made with cinnamon, to a pair of leather baby shoes, to an
old fashioned wooden coat rack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And
everything had a price on it, I think you probably could have bought the Amish
girl behind the counter for the right price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As we strolled through the wads of stuff waiting for our tour to begin a
bus load of senior citizens came into the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>They were part of some sort of group like the Retired Pretzel
Union people or some such nonsense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This group of senior citizens seemed to make as much noise as a bus load
of high school teenagers just let out for spring break.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Also keep in mind that the room is still 20
x 20 with all of that useless junk that now the bus load of old people seemed
so fascinated with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then a woman came
out from a room in back and said that the tour was about to begin.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She led us into a back room that was only
slightly larger than the front one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It
was divided by a waist high counter that corralled all of the visitors into a 3
x 10 foot area with the remaining space left over for the “pretzel factory”.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The factory consisted of about half a dozen
pieces of machinery each designed to perform some particular pretzel making
step.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The woman clamored on for about
10 minutes about the history and other useless facts about pretzels that I
can’t seem to remember.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After this our
tour was complete, and I thanked god as we left that it had stopped raining so
we didn’t have to go to the local Intercourse Potato Chip Factory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This about completed our trip to Lancaster, we did spend an
enjoyable evening at the local American Music Theater.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They had a show that was showcasing the
songs of the 40s and 50s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After this it
was on to our next stop Beaver Pennsylvania and a visit to our friends Nancy,
Jim and family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We arrived in Beaver
early in the evening and spent the early evening playing with Nancy and Jim’s
kids Mary Katherine, Annie, and Michael Joseph.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>That evening we had a good diner at a local restaurant with Nancy
and Jim and got caught up on the going’s on in all of our lives.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It also gave Nancy and Jim an excuse to have
Grandma come over and baby sit their kids for an evening, something which I
think they were looking forward too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The next day we spent the time around the Beaver area.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We went to a local playground and had fun
playing on the swings, the slide, and the various other children rides that I
had long forgotten from my youth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
spent the afternoon in downtown Beaver which was a really nice town.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the only real downtowns with actual
stores and shops that you could walk between.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>No strip malls, no Wal-Mart Super Center, no McDonalds.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just your local mom and pop stores with real
people in a real neighborhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was
nice to see that hometown America is still alive and well in Beaver.</p>

<h2>October 1, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ok so we haven’t updated the site in a while, but we have
been pretty busy (Well maybe not that busy, just lazy).<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We visited Steamtown, a local National Park
and train museum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We took a train ride
through Lackawanna county and saw a lot of old time steam engines.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then the first week in September we closed
on our condo in Boston.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So we are now
officially homeless out of work bums.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After this you would think that we would have left PA to
start our journey but that was not the case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Because the state of MA in it’s infinite wisdom decided to have our RV
registration expire in October right in the middle of our trip we needed to
transfer it to PA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You would think that
this should be a fairly quick process but nooooo.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>We found out that we couldn’t just register the RV in PA, the
state needed to transfer the title from MA to a PA title.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well that would be easy except for the fact
that we didn’t have the title for the RV, our bank did.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So we have been waiting now for about a week
to get the title from our bank to no avail. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So in the meantime we have spent some additional time
golfing and visiting our relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
also got a chance to go to Niagara falls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>We were only there a couple hours but it was a pretty awesome site to
see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the latest plan is to leave this Sunday, the 24<sup>th</sup>
of September, we will see…</p>

<h2>August 27, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>We spent this week in PA again.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Golfed three times this week, neither Giustina nor I broke 100
but Giustina had her best round ever with a 107.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Joe shot a 104 to beat his brother Jason in the first match in
their best of 3 series.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We spent Saturday the 26<sup>th</sup> in New York city.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The whole family went for the trip.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There was Joe and Giustina, Joe’s Mom and
Dad, Joe’s brother James and his wife Angie, and Joe’s other brother
Jason.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In all 7 people.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just image how you fit 7 full grown people
into a mini van and then force them to drive 2 hours to the most crowded city
in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The journey to New York
provided the majority of comedy for the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I was going to recount the stories but words just do not do justice to
it and plus I’m lazy and on vacation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We spend the morning at the Hayden Planetarium and saw their
space show with the new multimillion dollar star projector.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a pretty good show and really made
you feel just how small a part of the overall universe you really are.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the afternoon we saw the Broadway musical
Jeckell and Hyde.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The musical was Ok
but since it was a matinee most of the understudies were playing the lead
roles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After the show we went to dinner
at Gallager’s steak house, a real casual red meat kinda place.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Good food, standard New York prices, and snotty
New York waiters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All in all a very
nice trip.</p>

<h2>August 20, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Winnebago is back in PA now and stationary in Mom and
Dad’s driveway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No excursions this
week.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Giustina’s sister got married on Sunday the 20<sup>th</sup>
so a lot of time was spent planning and preparing for this.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everything went off without a hitch though
and it was a very nice ceremony.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>August 13, 2000</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well the time finally came for our first real<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>RV trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The trip was a journey from Pennsylvania to Boston.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We planned to spend the first couple nights
in our condo in Cambridge while we left the RV in a campground for safe
keeping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We had a little difficulty
trying to find a spot in a campground, it seemed that a lot of parents decided
that August is a good time to take a final family summer vacation.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After calling every campground in the
greater Boston area we finally found one “spot” in Mansfield, MA.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It seemed a little too good to be true, but
who were we to look a gift horse in the mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally after an exhausting 6 hour drive from PA to
Mansfield we arrived at the exit off of 495 around 8:30PM.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In following the directions to the
campground we discovered that the city of Mansfield decided to tear up the road
from 495 to the campground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>How nice of
them considering it was difficult enough to keep a 35 foot RV on a 2 lane road,
why not make it more difficult for us by removing the pavement and adding in a
few dozen pot holes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well we finally
get through the road from hell and arrived at the campground. <span
style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We park just outside the “office” (The only
reason I call it an office is that it is the only building that does not have
wheels) and I go in to check in and get our space.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>As I am talking with the woman behind the counter I can’t help
but notice that of the 20 or so people who are milling around the office, only
myself and the woman behind the counter are the ones who are wearing a shirt
with sleeves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think to myself, Ok
it’s hot out I can kinda understand that…and I moved on.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During the process of checking in the woman
behind the counter tells me that we will have space 11G tonight and then
tomorrow we will have to move to space 12G.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Ok, no big deal since we were only using it for a parking space tonight
anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She gives me a map to our space
and points me in the correct direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I go back out to the RV and drive through their “security
gate” which consists of a piece of PVC piping connected to an arm that goes up
and down, I feel safer already.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We
start to drive through the campground and notice that EVERYONE in the
campground has Christmas lights hung up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Some have them on their campers, some on trees, but they are everywhere,
it really looks like Disney World with all the lights.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other thing we realize at this point is
that the roads in the campground really just weren’t build for a 102 inch wide
35 foot motor home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we navigate at 5
mph through the park we finally arrive at the section where our space was
located.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A really nice fellow camper
points our space out to us, since by now it was completely dark and there are
no lights, other than those of the Christmas variety around.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We look to the space next to the one where
we are supposed to go into and can’t help but take notice of what I would call
a 37 foot Christmas tree with windows and a door.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>It was a Fleetwood Bounder motor home with so many Christmas
lights on it, it took me a few minutes to figure out that there was a motor
home underneath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There were lights on
the large awning, lights on the slide out awning, lights strung from tree to
tree, lights on all sides, and in the front a bunch of colored icicle lights
hanging down over the windshield.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After
we got over our amazement and regained our sight from the light blindness we
backed our motor home into the site and left it for the night as we ventured
into Cambridge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day we had to drive back to Mansfield because if
you remember we had to move our motor home from space 11G to the space next
door 12G.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After we arrived at the
campground and passed through the “security” gate again we drove through the
campground and noticed that a large number of the inhabitants really don’t
understand the concept of <b>MOBILE </b>in mobile home.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some folks have brought their full size
porch swings, their screened in porches usually bigger than their actual
trailers, more flowers and garden crap than you would find at Home Depot, and
satellite dishes as you would expect we noticed one satellite dish that was
permanently mounted to a nearby tree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>As we arrived at our space, comforted in the fact that it was still
there, we realized that space 12G was occupied by that Fleetwood Bounder with
the 10,000 Christmas lights strung around it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>This presented a problem because there was no one around it packing
anything up or moving the RV in anyway. <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>They even had the water and power lines for the RV buried in an
underground trench so they wouldn’t have to step over them.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since the campground only gave us the time
between check out at 1:30PM and check in at 2PM to move our RV we were
perplexed as to what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We drove
back up to the campground “office” and discussed our situation with the owner’s
wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She said that the folks in space
12G probably forgot that they were supposed to leave today.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apparently they had been around for a while
and also owed the campground a good deal of money.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>The woman said she would have her husband talk to folks in 12G to
get them to move but that in the meantime we would need to move our RV to a
different space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I reluctantly obliged
her since I didn’t have much choice, keeping in mind that all the other
campgrounds were sold out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we left the office we ran into the owner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He was a rather large man about 6 feet tall
and around 300 pounds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was also a
rather humid day, so I found it odd that he was wearing a blue sweatshirt and
maroon sweatpants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He stated that he
talked to the folks in 12G and they misunderstood when their last day was, but
that they would be checked out in a few hours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Well we still had a great deal of packing to do back in Cambridge so we
really didn’t have a couple of hours to waste hanging around the RV park.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In the process of talking to him he was
having a second conversation with another “gentleman” friend of his.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They were discussing the fact that another
patron had abandoned a trailer on their campground with several cats and he had
to go inside this trailer for some random reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>As he was talking to us in mid conversation he picked something
off of his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then he jumped around
like he was trying to shake something off of his body in what seemed like an
epileptic fit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Apparently the cats that
were left in the abandoned trailer had flees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Then near the end of his conversation with us, he said “Excuse me a
minute” and proceeded to rip off his sweatshirt thereby exposing his somewhat
round physique and threw his shirt to the ground trying to beat the flees out
of it as he jumped around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At this
point in the conversation we decided to excuse ourselves and just come back
tomorrow.</p>
